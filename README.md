# GoF_Design_Patterns_Examples


My examples with OOP design patterns:

  1. Structural Design Patterns
    Command pattern. (commandKey.py) 
      - Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
      - Undo action.
      - Compose behavion.
    Facade. (facadeKey.py)
      - Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
      - Reduces complexity
      - Protect Client classes
      - Maintability
      
  2. Behavior Design Patterns
    Interpreter. (interpreterKet.py)
      - Implements a specialized language.
    Mediator. (mediatorKey.py)
      - Intermediary class
      - One class mange othet classes
    Memento. (mementoKey.py)
      - Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
      - Captures the internal state of object.
     State.  (stateKey.py)
      - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
     Template Method. (templateKey.py)
      - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
      - Polymorphism
      - Methods to be overridden
      - Protected meethods
